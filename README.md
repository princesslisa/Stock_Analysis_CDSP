# Stock_Analysis_CDSP

Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard. 

This project is part of the Coursera Python Project for Data Science course. The main aim of this project was to explain and practice webscraping as well as analyse stocks with yfinance library and build a dashboard.
Practicing as a data scientist working for a hedge fund, this project will extract the profit data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the profit for the hedge fund.
